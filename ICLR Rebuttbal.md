Q1: I think this is an explicit assumption on the prior distribution, which contradicts to $\spadesuit$ how can we obtain a tractable estimate for $\Phi (k)$ without presuming any particular prior distribution of $\hat{p}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\mathbf{z}|k \right)$

#### Reviewer WvTp
Q1: Clarify “Without loss of generality, we employ latent features z extracted from deep models as a surrogate for the original high-dimensional raw data x. This is because z is deterministic within the post-hoc framework”

Q1: How to choose $p$

A1:

Q2: For long-tailed OOD detection when the ID training data exhibits an imbalanced class distribution, I guess the accuracy of the importance sampling-based estimation may decrease given a limited number of tail-class predictions. elaborate why their method still outperforms in the long-tailed scenarios.
